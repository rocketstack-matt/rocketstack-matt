### Hi there, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

**Matthew Bain** is a Senior Technologist in the Finance industry. For over 20 years I've worked for some of the world's largest investment banks. Over the years I've built Trading Systems, Data Platforms, Video Streaming Apps and overly adventurous Excel workbooks.

My current focus is on improving how we capture and evolve System Architectures and drive Modernization of our legacy platforms. In particular I'm interested in how we can codify system architectures to enable greater automation and be able to evidence that what we say we'd build is what we actually built, something particularly important in highly regulated industries.

I was awarded the title of Distinguished Engineer in 2022 and hope to inspire the next generation of Software Engineers and Architects.

Outside of work, I'm an avid follower of technology of all sorts, love to travel, read and cook. I live with my wife Siobhan, children Cillian & Fintan and an annoying dog called Lyra in London, England where you'll often find me watching cricket at [The Oval](https://www.kiaoval.com/).

<!-- I occasionally post on my blog [The Accidental Architect](http://accidental-architect.com). -->
